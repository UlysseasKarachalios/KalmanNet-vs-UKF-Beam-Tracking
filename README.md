# KalmanNet-vs-UKF-Beam-Tracking
Solution of the Beam Tracking problem using KalmanNet network for my BSc Thesis "Model-Based and Data-Driven Kalman Filtering"
## KalmanNet code
The solution uses the KalmanNet implementation from paper "KalmanNet: Neural Network Aided Kalman Filtering for Partially Known Dynamics"

## Unscented Kalman filter code
We also use the Unscented Kalman Filter implementation from FilterPy Library
